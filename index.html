    The lang attribute in HTML specifies the primary language of a webpage, helping search engines and screen readers provide better accessibility and accurate translations for users. This is especially important for multilingual audiences and SEO optimization. Meta tags, on the other hand, provide essential metadata about a webpage, such as descriptions, keywords, and author information. They enhance user experience by improving how content is displayed in search engine results and ensuring proper indexing by search engines. Together, the lang attribute and meta tags contribute to a more accessible, user-friendly, and discoverable website.
